Utilizing a highly interdisciplinary approach, students will study historical and contemporary examples of social change to evaluate strategies for promoting change (e.g. social movements, narrative, policy and economic change, individual behavior change, and culture change).  They will develop their own theory of change and apply this theory to issues of energy and climate, natural resources and social equity."
"Environment & Community","4","-","-","Why do we hear call to ""think globally, act locally"" with regard to the environment?  Why might communities be particularly well suited to push for environmental change, but also be a locus of environmental conflict?  This course explores environmental issues, actions, and debates through the lens of community.  We assess ""community"" as a critical unit of social action for promoting positive environmental change, through the exploration of community-based environmental movements.

"Remembrance As Social Action","4","-","Social Systems Literacy (SOC-L)","The representation of history in textbooks and museums or through monuments is never a neutral endeavor but rather an inspection of prevailing power structures and social hierarchies.  The notion ""History is written by the victors"" underscores how dominant groups curate collective memory, privileging certain narratives while erasing or marginalizing others in order to sustain authority and to create a desired shared identity.  While in Munster and during our course excursions, we will explore manifestations of remembrance as interpretation of history and the social circumstances that created them.  In many cases the subject of remembrance is secondary to the form that the remembrance takes and to the social circumstances that brought forth the remembrance.  We will look at issues of power, propaganda, ideology, and collective memory."

"The Long Civil Rights Era: Black Nationalism to Black Power","4","-","-","Adopting a ""Long Civil Rights Movement"" framework, we will examine how African Americans adopted various strategies to bring effective meaning tot their citizenship status and expand the boundaries of American democracy.  Instead of limiting our study to the ""classical phase"" of the movement between 1954 and the early 1970s, we will begin in the 1930s and end with contemporary activism such as the Black Live Matter movement.  Through an extended periodization of what is traditionally considered the Civil Rights Movement, the class reveals how the struggle for civil rights was not a singular moment in the mid 20th century, by a sustained, multidimensional, ideologically diverse movement that continues to the present.  Using a range of primary and secondary sources, we will pay particular attention to the regional dynamics of African American civil rights movements and the role of gender in these movements.

"Everybody Loves Gandhi","4","-","-","M. K. Gandhi remains the Indian most indelibly associated with India, one of the most frequently-quoted thinkers of all time, and one of the most important figures in developing the theory and practice of non-violent resistance. However, Gandhi's ideas and philosophy have managed to become detached from the historical context in which they were created, and indeed from the human being who created them. This course examines Gandhi's life, political positions, and political legacies in India and globally, in an effort to re-evaluate his achievements and failures, to place his life within the broader historical context of India in the early twentieth century, and to consider the reasons why some people, since his death, have variously beatified and demonized the man and his ideas.
